  <h1>Signal at Dawn</h1>
  <p>The archive records that at <strong>05:12 UTC</strong> the AXIOM listening post on Luna received a repeating burst. The modulation did not match any known civilian or military signature.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>"Command, this is Node-04. We have pattern, twelve cycles so far. Recommend escalation to ORIGIN map."</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Analysts marked the event as the first verified contact with the Sigma lattice. Further orders were relayed to stations within <abbr title="Automated eXperimentation Interlink Operations Mesh">AXIOM</abbr> to enter <strong>Protocol Amber</strong>.</p>
